# Repository Skills

In addition to the Copilot instructions, this repository includes a set
of helper documents that describe capabilities and tools an AI assistant
can use when interacting with the project.

## flutter_docs_skill

The `flutter_docs_skill` allows an assistant to answer questions about
Flutter by referencing a locally built index of the official Flutter
documentation.

See `docs/FLUTTER_DOCS_SKILL.md` for details on how to generate and
extend this index. The underlying script lives at
`tool/flutter_docs_skill.dart` and outputs `tool/docs_index.json`.
