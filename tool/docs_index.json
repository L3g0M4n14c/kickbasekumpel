For details, check out the Flutter 3.41 blog post. Docs updated or added since the 3.38 release In addition to many smaller updates, here are some of the more significant changes: We have introduced a new getting started experience for both Flutter and Dart, as announced in a recent blog post. You can find the Flutter learning pathway under the Learn tab at the top of docs.flutter.dev. To return to the rest of the site, select the Guides tab. As always, the Reference tab takes you to the Flutter API docs. Flutter and Dart now have an official glossary. As part of the recent migration of the websites to Jaspr, a glossary has been added to the Flutter website. Expect to see it grow in the fullness of time. As always, check out the breaking changes page for this release, which includes links to migration guides and other vital information. A special thank you to navaronbracke, who wrote a migration guide for the deprecation of the onReorder callback. 12 November 2025: Release 3.38 # Flutter 3.38 is live! For details, check out the Flutter 3.38 technical blog post. Website update A significant update to the website has recently landed! As with the update to the dart.dev website that landed earlier this year, the docs.flutter.dev website has been reimplemented to use Jaspr, a Dart web framework. Let us know what you think! Docs updated or added since the 3.35 release The Dart language now supports dot shorthands syntax (aka shorthands), which allows you to write more concise code. For more information, visit the Dart dot shorthands page on dart.dev. Over time, the samples on this website will be updated to take advantage of this new feature. The flutter run command now supports a configuration file that allows you to specify web settings like host, port, certification, and header. The web dev config file also supports proxy settings, making it possible to forward specific path requests to another server. This makes it easier to develop a web client that connects to dynamic endpoints on the same host. For more information, visit setting up a web development configuration file. Development continues on the Flutter Widget Previewer tool, introduced as an experimental feature in the 3.35 release. For this release, the previewer better integrates with the VS Code and IntelliJ IDEs (including Android Studio). It's still an experimental feature. For more info about the latest version, check out the Widget Previewer tool page. The Flutter 3.38 release fully supports the platform releases for iOS 26, Xcode 26, and macOS 26, all of which were released in September. For the most recent info on Flutter's support for iOS, visit Flutter on latest iOS. Flutter 3.38 supports the new Apple-mandated UIScene lifecycle. To support this, code migration is required. For more information, visit the UIScene migration guide. With a focus on improving Flutter's accessibility, the accessibility docs have also been completely reworked. Also, don't forget to check out the breaking changes page for this release. That's where you'll find information about breaking changes, code deprecations, and migration guides.
